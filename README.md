#Another Golang MAAS API Client library

A lighter version fo the `MAAS API client library` originally taken from [https://github.com/juju/gomaasapi](https://github.com/juju/gomaasapi]).
The Developers there have done and continue doing amazing work. Please review their solution before using this.


Here we present a light version for my own purposes. Feel free to contribute. Because it is light
calls are more direct and there are/will be less helper code. We also leverage golang a bit more
making use of json marshalling and tags.
